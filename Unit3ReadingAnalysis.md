B:  When the Greeks had been in Troy for ten years, Epeus made a beautiful wooden horse of great magnitude. Those who gathered were Menelaus, Ulixēs, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, and Neoptolemus, and on the horse they wrote "Danaus gave a gift to Minerva", and they moved the camp to Tenedo. When the Trojans saw this, Priam led the horse into the temple of Minerva. When Cassandra said that the enemy had a horse, they did not believe her and they put the horse in the temple. The Greeks came out and killed the guards and conquered Troy.
