A regular Latin verb has four principal parts.
The first and third principal parts are finite verb forms. Both principal parts are in the first person and are singular. 
The relationship between the verbs interficiō and faciō can be compared to the phrases "to make" and "to make up your mind". Interficiō and faciō are identical in the third principal part. In the other principal parts, the vowels change after the "inter" prefix. 
Two verbs in the fourth conjugation are audīre and venīre. Their principal parts are regular.
The verbs "capiō" and "faciō" are the exact same. When the principal part of each verb changes, they each share the same ending.
